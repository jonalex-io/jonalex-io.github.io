                Hi, my name's Jonathan! I'm a Canadian composer, multi-instrumentalist
                producer, and classically trained jazz musician of Cantonese and Scottish heritage…
            </strong>
            <br><br>
            My musical journey began from the age of five, rigorously training in the art of classical piano and
            cultivating a keen sense of technicality within the Royal Conservatory of Music. However, during my
            rebellious teenage years, my impatience with the rigidity of classical music led me to stumble upon the
            improvisatory world of jazz——The works of Hiromi Uehara, Oscar Peterson, and Chick Corea ultimately inspired
            me to explore new forms of music beyond the western tradition. Since then, and especially looking at these
            influences, multiculturalism has remained a focal point of my musical journey: from learning Japanese fusion
            jazz piano to playing finger-style and flamenco guitar; then from learning Chinese erhu to producing hip-hop
            beats and mastering digital audio production; all under the aspiration of becoming a musical polyglot, and
            proving especially pertinent in my choice to become a composer.
            <br><br>
            As for composition, my journey began in Vancouver at the University of British Columbia where my discovery
            of scoring for interactive media via the Game Dev Club prompted my immediate conversion to studying music
            full-time. I eventually settled at the University of Lethbridge where I began formally studying composition.
            There, I also continued fuelling my multi-instrumentalist addiction and passion for orchestration by renting
            every instrument I could find.
            <br><br>
            During my studies, I have continued freelance composing for award-winning games and animations, all while
            training in composing concert music under the mentorship of Dr. Arlan N. Schultz.
            <br><br>
            ~lastly, after my forty hours of daily music practice, I enjoy climbing rocks, gymnastically tumbling, and
            programming machines to do my bidding. 🧗‍♀️🤸‍♀️💻(^-^)
            <br><br>

        <!-- 另外故事（VIFF2023） -->
        <!-- <p>
            My experience with visual media began in Vancouver at the University of British Columbia. I had initially
            enrolled to study computer science, however, after joining the game development club I was tasked with
            writing the music for a VR experience titled Eden’s Garden. The project ended up winning the club’s year-end
            showcase and prompted my immediate conversion to studying music full-time.

            From UBC, I eventually returned to study in my hometown at the University of Lethbridge—a modest school but
            one allowing the freedom to rent and learn every instrument in the orchestra, thus fuelling what would
            become my multi-instrumentalist addiction and passion for orchestration. During my studies, I continued
            scoring for competitions, animations, and video games. In my first and second year of study, I collaborated
            with students undertaking the prestigious animation program at Sheridan College, scoring my first credits in
            the short films “Dozen Buns: Carrot Case,” and “Liv,” both in collaboration with the character designer
            Paige McMorrow. In my third year I once again collaborated with students from UBC game dev, writing music
            for the marketing and adaptive in-game events of a game tentatively titled “Mythos” which went on to win
            UBC’s year-end game dev showcase along with the first prize award at Vancouver’s very own game development
            conference.

            Of course, my time scoring for media has been supplemented with technical training under the direction of
            Dr. Arlan N. Schultz, professor of composition at the University of Lethbridge. My recent years have been
            primarily focused on the theoretical application of writing long-form concert music and mastering
            orchestration by writing chamber pieces for each of the orchestral instrument groups. This past May I
            completed my first Brass Quintet and I am continuing to write a series of chamber pieces under the title
            "Songs for Small Ensembles" as part of my graduation recital.
