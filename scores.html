                In my Jazz Quartet pieces, <strong> "Consolation" </strong> and <strong> "Pseudonym," </strong> I
                explored the art of guided improvisation
                through lead sheets. Both pieces share a fascination with the diminished four-note chord as a source of
                harmonic movement. However, unlike in my Brass Quintet, while diminished harmony is indeed used as
                inspiration, I deliberately avoided the diminished scale here. Instead, the diminished chord served as a
                foundation for harmonic progressions and leaping melodies, and I was deliberate not to fall into the
                habit of octatonic voice leading. Lastly, on a compositional note, these are the only two pieces in my
                graduation recital not composed entirely within a Digital Audio Workstation.
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp
                <strong>
                    "Consolation” (ballad)
                </strong>
                drew
                inspiration from diverse sources, including John Coltrane's "Naima," the film scores of Jerry Goldsmith
                ("Chinatown") and Daniel Pemberton ("Motherless Brooklyn"), the Pokemon Diamond and Pearl title theme,
                and even the simple word imagery of the word "bogus." Here, I aimed to create a textural soundscape,
                encouraging the double bass to utilize bowed passages and the saxophone player to explore extended
                techniques and pitch bending. The piano is instructed to play simple four-note chords over an
                alternating Ab A pedal, gradually straying from overtones typically found in the harmonic series of
                these two pedals.
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp
                <strong>
                    "Pseudonym" (uptempo)
                </strong> was a playful homage to some of my favorite musical influences.
                The opening lick was inspired by the anime "Great Pretender," while the free jazz spirit echoed the
                sounds of "Gundam Thunderbolt." Traces of Ornette Coleman, Hiromi Uehara, and even the "JoJo's Bizarre
                Adventure" theme can also be found woven into the fabric of the piece. Admittedly, this piece may have
                simply been an indulgence in my favorite licks and progressions, particularly a sequence of four
                dominant seventh chords arpeggiating the notes of a diminished seventh chord

        <div class="content score-container">
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp
                In my String Trio, I embarked on a dual mission: to delve into the world of guitar writing, a realm
                completely distinct from composing for other instruments, and to further hone my skills in writing for
                violin and cello. The Waltz, titled “Valse Rêverie,” was envisioned as the first movement of a larger
                suite, and employed both quartal harmony and pentatonic melodies to create its musical world. The
                imagery that guided this composition was a winter scene in a central city park – a frozen lake, perhaps
                including the graceful reflections of dancing figure skaters. Several musical influences informed this
                work. Ravel's Piano Trio in A minor provided a foundation, while Yasunori Nishiki's score for the video
                game Octopath Traveller offered a touch of contemporary inspiration. Additionally, the guitar works of
                Heitor Villa-Lobos, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and William Walton served as guiding lights for exploring
                the guitar’s unique potential within the trio's texture.

        <div class="content score-container">
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp
                Derived from material used in my previous work, a quintet for brass, this wind quintet continues my
                exploration into contrapuntal styles, prioritizing horizontal melodic development in a modal framework
                while disregarding traditional key signature. In contrast with my brass piece, my goal here was to
                compose something tuneful and singsong-like, perhaps as a result of my previous work's dip into
                atonality and dissonance. Overall, the composition draws much inspiration from the English composer
                Malcolm Arnold and his penchant for evoking imagery of the sea. As for the individual movements, I,
                "Prelude,” was influenced by the works of Holst, especially his "Song of the Blacksmith.” And in II,
                "The Valley,” the bounding arpeggiations drew much inspiration from Justin Hurwitz's work on the film
                "La La Land," while the opening solo and trio sprouted from my childhood recollections of watching the
                film "Kiki's Delivery Service." In the latter of which, the scenes overlooking the town by the shore and
                the scenes featuring a laggardly dog were most inspiring.

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp
                “Brass Quintet” was written for my graduation recital at the University of Lethbridge under the
                influence of Silicon Valley grindset culture. It is my first multi-movement work with three movements in
                total. Programmatically, “Source” (I) begins with the indulgent optimism of a startup founder hot on the
                heels of securing their first angel list seed, only to thereafter be mauled and torn down by a bearish
                dip in morale. Nevertheless, their time spent in what has been referred to as “The Dip” (II) sparks an
                unyielding thirst for self-improvement; thus, twelve self-help books later and armed with the koanic
                mantra 'real artists ship,' the founder ignores all pivots and finally begins sprinting in a straight
                line. Now equipped with a rejuvenated sense of purpose and drive——likely fuelled by mushroom-infused
                decaf——the founder transcends their reality distortion field, switching from zero to one, and rides the
                bull to a triumphant victory per their “Exit Strategy (III).”

                    "Source" marks what I would consider my first deliberate attempt at applying formal structure to a
                    composition during pre-production. The work was conceived in a fugato style, alternating between
                    soft contrapuntal sections and grande chordal sections. My intention was to follow a traditional
                    AABA structure using the B section as a complete tonal and timbral shift, however, I realized much
                    to my dismay that the B section I was writing was becoming a different piece entirely! I have since
                    split the sections into two pieces (see my “Wind Quintet”). "Source" is the reduction of nearly 9
                    minutes of material.

                    Inspired by Seth Godin's book of the same title, "The Dip" is the first chamber piece I have fully
                    notated while attending the University of Lethbridge. This piece marks my beginnings of getting
                    familiar with brass instruments and also exploring their extended techniques (singing multiphonics,
                    blowing air, etc.). “The Dip” also marks my stylistic exploration of horizontal writing by paying
                    little attention to vertical harmony and focusing moreso on interval character. The piece was also
                    an exploration in chromatic counterpoint, motivic development, and long-form structure. At seven
                    minutes, the duration of this movement surpassed my previous works two-fold.

                    “Exit Strategy” is characterized by sharp staccato accents, off-kilter rhythms, and octatonic riffs
                    with roaring glissandi. Of the three movements in my “Brass Quintet”, it expresses the least
                    harmonic consonance in a collection which decays further and further into harmonic collapse——you
                    could say the frenzied dissonance paired with the title are apt allusions of my panicked escape from
                    finally completing a piece over one year in the making! (description continued below the score)

                <p>
                    &nbsp&nbsp
                    While writing “Exit Strategy” I became familiar with Prokofiev’s Piano Sonata No. 7 which relies
                    heavily on the repetition of a single rhythmic motive. The idea of committing to a single rhythmic
                    motive is ultimately what helped inform the structural foundation for “Exit Strategy.” As for the
                    formal structure, and as with Prokofiev’s Piano Sonata, the structure of “Exit Strategy” is
                    symmetrical. In fact, the symmetrical structuring here is the first example of a piece I have
                    written using a pre-prescribed form from which I haven’t deviated; in this case, modified rondo:
                    intro ABA CD[AC] ABA outro.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp
                    Note, In contrast, The first two movements of my “Brass Quintet” were born of singular melodic cells
                    and developed in a fugue-like or generative manner with ill-defined endpoints. Overall, pre-defining
                    the end of the third movement seems to have bolstered my will to finish in a more predictable and
                    timely fashion than with the first two.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp
                    As for the sections within the structure of “Exit Strategy,” the thematic and emotional moods were
                    designed more or less to alternate. Atonal discourse amongst the five brass soloists is contrasted
                    by bouts of leaping heroism and melodic reconciliation. The middle D section functions as the main
                    timbral shift, featuring a scurrying baba yaga-esque bass-line as muted horns jeer and caw from
                    above.
                    <br>&nbsp&nbsp
                    To conclude, “Exit Strategy” finalizes my year-plus-long stint of applied study in the realms of
                    tonal counterpoint, parametric counterpoint, formal structure, atonal writing techniques,
                    non-functional harmony, timbral orchestration, brass instruments, and on and on. Perhaps the most
                    important lesson in completing my Brass Quintet has been learning to commit to finishing a project
                    in its entirety, and constructing a long-form piece without relying on repetition but rather
                    employing developing variation.

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp
                My arrangement of the Super Mario 64 classic “Bob-omb Battlefield” was done while undergoing a score
                study of Charlie Rosen's arrangement of the same piece for the 8-Bit Big Band. This arrangement
                functioned as my application for the University of Lethbridge's Jazz Ensemble Composer in Residency
                program. The piano in the recording was performed by insaneintherain (aka Carlos Eine), and the
                remaining instruments were performed and recorded by yours truly.
